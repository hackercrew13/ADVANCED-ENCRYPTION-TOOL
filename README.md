## Description
This is a simple Python-based encryption tool that uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) to encrypt and decrypt files. It allows users to securely protect their files and later decrypt them when needed.

## Features
- Encrypts files using AES encryption
- Decrypts encrypted files back to original
- Uses a randomly generated 128-bit AES key
- Simple command-line interface

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3 and the required libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pycryptodome
```

## Installation
Clone this repository and navigate into the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/encryption-tool.git
cd encryption-tool
```

## Usage
Run the script with Python:

```bash
python3 encryption_tool.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts:
1. Choose **(E)** to encrypt a file or **(D)** to decrypt a file.
2. Enter the file name.

## Example
### Encrypting a file:
```
AES Encryption Tool
Do you want to (E)ncrypt or (D)ecrypt a file? e
Enter file name: dot.txt
File 'dot.txt' encrypted successfully.
```

### Decrypting a file:
```
AES Encryption Tool
Do you want to (E)ncrypt or (D)ecrypt a file? d
Enter file name: dot.txt.enc
File 'dot.txt.enc' decrypted successfully.
```

## File Structure
```
encryption_tool.py   # Main script for encryption/decryption
dot.txt              # Sample text file
dot.txt.enc          # Encrypted file output
README.md            # Documentation
